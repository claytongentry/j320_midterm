  <p class='story'>On March 25, the Seeley G. Mudd Library at Northwestern University closed its doors to facilitate a major renovation and expansion project. Construction began on December 1, 2015, and is scheduled to be completed by August 1, 2017.</p>
  <p class='story'>Muddâ€™s closure has forced students who normally studied there to relocate to the Charles Deering Library and the Northwestern University Library.</p>
  <p class='story'>Divir Gupta, a 22-year-old Northwestern senior studying computer science, said that while he enjoys Deering, he misses meeting his friends in Mudd. Gupta said his friends all have classes in the Northwestern Technological Institute on the north end campus.</p>
